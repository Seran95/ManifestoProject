                <p><strong>Good design is innovative.</strong>
                    <br>
                 The possibilities for innovation are not, by any means, exhausted. Technological development is always offering new <a href="level4.3.html">opportunities</a> for innovative design. But innovative design always develops in tandem with innovative technology, and can never be an end in itself.
                </p>
          
                <p><strong>Good design makes a product useful.</strong> 
                    <br>
                A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy certain criteria, not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic. Good design emphasises the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything that could possibly detract from it.</p>
        
                <p><strong>Good design is aesthetic.</strong>
                    <br>
                The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because products we use every day affect our person and our well being. But only well executed objects can be beautiful.</p>
            
                <p><strong>Good design makes a product understandable.</strong>
                    <br>
                It clarifies the products structure. Better still, it can make the product talk. At best, it is self explanatory.</p>
           
                <p><strong>Good design is unobtrusive.</strong>
                    <br>
                Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the users self expression.</p>
            
                <p><strong>Good design is honest.</strong>
                    <br>
                It does not make a product more innovative, powerful or valuable than it really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be kept.</p>
            
                <p><strong>Good design is long lasting.</strong>
                    <br>
                It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated. Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many years even in todays throwaway society.</p>
            
                <p><strong>Good design is thorough down to the last detail.</strong>
                    <br>
                Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the design process show respect towards the consumer.</p>
       
                <p><strong>Good design is environmentally friendly.</strong>
                    <br>
                Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the environment. It conserves resources and minimises physical and visual pollution throughout the lifecycle of the product.</p>
           
            
           
                <p><strong>Good design is as little design as possible.</strong>
                    <br>
                Less, but better because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non essentials. Back to purity, back to simplicity.</p>
